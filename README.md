> Username, full name, email address, GitHub username of the current
> user

For the username it tries the `LOGNAME`, `USER`, `LNAME` and `USERNAME`
environment variables first. If these are all unset, or set to an empty
string, then it tries running `id` on Unix-like systems and `whoami` on
Windows.

For the full name of the user, it queries the system services and also
tries the user’s global git configuration. On Windows, it tries finding
the global git configuration in `Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE")` if it
doesn’t find it in `Sys.getenv("HOME")` (often “Documents”).

For the email address it uses the user’s global git configuration. It
tries finding the global git configuration in
`Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE")` if it doesn’t find it in
`Sys.getenv("HOME")`.

For the GitHub username it uses the `GITHUB_USERNAME` environment
variable then it tries searching on GitHub for the user’s email address.
