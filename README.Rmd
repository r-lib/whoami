> Username, full name, email address, GitHub username of the current user

For the username it tries the `LOGNAME`, `USER`, `LNAME` and
`USERNAME` environment variables first. If these are all unset,
or set to an empty string, then it tries running `id` on Unix-like
systems and `whoami` on Windows.

For the full name of the user, it queries the system services and
also tries the user's global git configuration. On Windows, it tries finding the global git configuration in `Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE")` if it doesn't find it in `Sys.getenv("HOME")` (often "Documents").

For the email address it uses the user's global git configuration. It tries finding the global git configuration in `Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE")` if it doesn't find it in `Sys.getenv("HOME")`.

For the GitHub username it uses the `GITHUB_USERNAME` environment variable then it tries searching on GitHub for the user's email
address.
